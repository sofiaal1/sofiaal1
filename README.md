<h2 align="center">Hi, I'm Sofia Alvazzi!</h2>

I'm a student at **Tufts University** studying **Computer Science & Quantitative Economics**. I'm passionate about building projects & systems that address real challenges people and companies face. I love exploring how Computer Science intersects with other fields like: 
- Finance & economic modeling
- Healthcare systems
- Bioinformatics, specifically computational neuroscience
- Data-driven decision making

In my free time, I enjoy **reading** (especially memoirs), **skiing**, and trying out **new places to eat** in Boston!
